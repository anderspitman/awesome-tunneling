The purpose of this list is to track and compare tunneling solutions. This is
primarily targeted toward self-hosters and developers who want to do things
like exposing a local webserver via a public domain name, with automatic HTTPS,
even if behind a NAT or other restricted network.

# The dream

I started this list because I'm looking for a simple tool/service that does the
following:

* Allows me to register a domain name and automatically points the records at
  the server running the tunnels.
* Automatically sets up and manages HTTPS certificates (apex and subdomains)
  for the domain.
* Provides a client tool that tunnels HTTP/TCP connections through the server
  without requiring root on the client.
* Provides a simple GUI interface to allow me to map X domain/subdomain to Y port
  on Z client, and proxy all connections to that domain.

So far I haven't found a tool that does all of this. In particular, while some
of them can do automatic certs through Lets's Encrypt, none of them integrate
the domain registration and DNS management.

**UPDATE:** Since starting this list I found most of the other solutions to be
either too complicated or making different tradeoffs than I would want. I have
two of my own projects in this space:

1. [SirTunnel](https://github.com/anderspitman/SirTunnel) is I believe the
minimal way of getting auto-HTTPS tunneled through to a private network.
It's just a 50-line Python script that leverages Caddy and OpenSSH, but you
need to understand how it works to use it. This one is good for developers.

2. [boringproxy](https://boringproxy.io/) is my take on a comprehensive tunnel
proxy solution. It's in beta but currently solves almost everything I want except
auto DNS management, and that's planned. Once the server is running this is a very
easy tool to use, and is targeted at non-developers.

Doesn't include an HTTPS proxy on the public side, but could be combined with nginx/Caddy/etc. Client [code](https://github.com/tailscale) available with a BSD3 license + separate patents file.
* [Loophole](https://loophole.cloud/) - Offers end-to-end TLS encryption with the client automatically getting certs from Let's Encrypt. QR codes for URL sharing. Client is open source. Can serve a local directory over WebDAV. MIT License. Written in Go.
* [localhost.run](https://localhost.run/) - Simple hosted SSH option. Supports custom domains for a cost.
* [Packetriot](https://packetriot.com) - Comprehensive alternative to ngrok.  HTTP Inspector, Let's Encrypt integration, doesn't require root and Linux repos for apt, yum and dnf.  Enterprise licenses and self-hosted option.
* [Hoppy](https://hoppy.network/) - WireGuard-based. Provides static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for your machines, which is a simple and useful level of abstraction. Targeted towards self-hosters and people behind NATs.
* [gw.run](https://gw.run/) - Specifically focusing on securely exposing internal web apps to a group of people; not for publicly facing apps. Share access via email address then allow users to log in with common login providers like Google.
