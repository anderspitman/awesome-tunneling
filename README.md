The purpose of this list is to track and compare tunneling solutions. This is
primarily targeted toward self-hosters and developers who want to do things
like exposing a local webserver via a public domain name, with automatic HTTPS,
even if behind a NAT or other restricted network.

# The dream

I started this list because I'm looking for a simple tool/service that does the
following:

* Allows me to register a domain name and automatically points the records at
  the server running the tunnels.
* Automatically sets up and manages HTTPS certificates (apex and subdomains)
  for the domain.
* Provides a client tool that tunnels HTTP/TCP connections through the server
  without requiring root on the client.
* Provides a simple GUI interface to allow me to map X domain/subdomain to Y port
  on Z client, and proxy all connections to that domain.

So far I haven't found a tool that does all of this. In particular, while some
of them can do automatic certs through Lets's Encrypt, none of them integrate
the domain registration and DNS management.

**UPDATE:** [boringproxy](https://boringproxy.io/) is my take on a solution to
this problem. It's in beta but currently solves everything above except auto
DNS management, and that's planned.

# Commercial/Closed source

* [ngrok 2.0](https://ngrok.com/) - Probably the gold standard and most popular. Closed source. Lots of features, including TLS and TCP tunnels. Doesn't require root to run client.
* [Tailscale](https://www.tailscale.com/) [![tailscale github stars badge](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/tailscale/tailscale?style=flat)](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/stargazers) - Built on WireGuard. Easy to use. Doesn't include an HTTPS proxy on the public side, but could be combined with nginx/Caddy/etc. Some [code](https://github.com/tailscale) available, but I'm not sure what the implications of the custom license is.
* [Loophole](https://loophole.cloud/) - Offers end-to-end TLS encryption with the client automatically getting certs from Let's Encrypt. QR codes for URL sharing.
* [CloudFlare Argo Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-tunnel/) - $5/mo + $0.1/GB. Integrates with Argo smart routing. Client source code is [available](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared).
* [localhost.run](https://localhost.run/) - Simple hosted SSH option. Supports custom domains for a cost.
* [Packetriot](https://packetriot.com) - Comprehensive alternative to ngrok.  HTTP Inspector, Let's Encrypt integration, doesn't require root and Linux repos for apt, yum and dnf.  Enterprise licenses and self-hosted option.
* [Lynk](https://lynk.sh/) - Advertises itself as a cheaper, faster, self-hostable (but not open source) alternative to ngrok. [Blog post](https://medium.com/@shivanshvij/building-a-better-ngrok-dbc104754822).
* [Hoppy](https://hoppy.network/) - WireGuard-based. Provides static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for your machines, which is a simple and useful level of abstraction. Targeted towards self-hosters and people behind NATs.
* [gw.run](https://gw.run/) - Specifically focusing on securely exposing internal web apps to a group of people; not for publicly facing apps. Share access via email address then allow users to log in with common login providers like Google.
* [serveo](https://serveo.net) - Mentioned quite a bit the last couple years, but appears to be down currently. Simply uses SSH for tunneling.
