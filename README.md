The purpose of this list is to track and compare tunneling solutions. This is
primarily targeted toward self-hosters and developers who want to do things
like exposing a local webserver via a public domain name, with automatic HTTPS,
even if behind a NAT or other restricted network.

**NOTE:** We're building a community around self-hosting, data ownership, and decentralization in general.
Join us over at [IndieBits.io](https://forum.indiebits.io).

# The dream

I started this list because I'm looking for a simple tool/service that does the
following:

* Allows me to register a domain name and automatically points the records at
  the server running the tunnels.
* Automatically sets up and manages HTTPS certificates (apex and subdomains)
  for the domain.
* Provides a client tool that tunnels HTTP/TCP connections through the server
  without requiring root on the client.
* Provides a simple GUI interface to allow me to map X domain/subdomain to Y port
  on Z client, and proxy all connections to that domain.

So far I haven't found a tool that does all of this. In particular, while some
of them can do automatic certs through Let's Encrypt, none of them integrate
the domain registration and DNS management in a simple way.

# Recommendations

* For most people, I currently recommend [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/). Although it's closed source, this is the production-quality service that gets the closest to achieving the dream. It's also a loss-leader for Cloudflare's other products which means they can offer it for free.
* If you want to self-host, there are many options. For something production ready [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) is probably what you want. If you're a developer, I'd recommend starting with my own [SirTunnel](https://github.com/anderspitman/SirTunnel) project and modifying it for your needs. For non-developers and those wanting more of a GUI experience, I created [boringproxy](https://boringproxy.io/). It's my take on a comprehensive tunnel proxy solution. It's in beta but currently solves almost everything I want. Once the server is running this is a very easy tool to use and has some nice features.
