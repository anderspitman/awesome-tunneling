The purpose of this list is to track and compare tunneling solutions. This is
primarily targeted toward self-hosters and developers who want to do things
like exposing a local webserver via a public domain name, with automatic HTTPS,
even if behind a NAT or other restricted network.

**NOTE:** We're building a community around self-hosting, data ownership, and decentralization in general.

# The dream

I started this list because I'm looking for a simple tool/service that does the
following:

* Allows me to register a domain name and automatically points the records at
  the server running the tunnels.
* Automatically sets up and manages HTTPS certificates (apex and subdomains)
  for the domain.
* Provides a client tool that tunnels HTTP/TCP connections through the server
  without requiring root on the client.
* Provides a simple GUI interface to allow me to map X domain/subdomain to Y port
  on Z client, and proxy all connections to that domain.

So far I haven't found a tool that does all of this. In particular, while some
of them can do automatic certs through Lets's Encrypt, none of them integrate
the domain registration and DNS management.

**UPDATE 2022-09-23:**

A lot of new tools have been developed since the list started, and many tools have been submitted for addition to the list. It's great to see so much interest in tunneling. That said, I want to make sure this remains a useful resource for not just listing all the possible options, but helping people pick one that will solve their problem. With that goal in mind, I've moved some of the items to a separate section at the bottom. This is dedicated to more complicated tools like overlay networks which can support tunneling and similar use cases, but aren't focused exclusively on tunneling. Please let me know if you think something is in the wrong section.

# Recommendations

* For most people, I currently recommend [CloudFlare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/). Although it's closed source, this is the production-quality service that gets the closest to achieving the dream. It's also a loss-leader for CloudFlare's other products which means they can offer it for free. Note that it's technically against their ToS to host anything other than basic HTML pages on the free plan, including photos, audio, and video. In practice I'm not aware of many instances of this being enforced.
* If you want to self-host, there are many options. For something production ready [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) is probably what you want. If you're a developer, I'd recommend starting with my own [SirTunnel](https://github.com/anderspitman/SirTunnel) project and modifying it for your needs. For non-developers and those wanting more of a GUI experience, I created [boringproxy](https://boringproxy.io/). It's my take on a comprehensive tunnel proxy solution. It's in beta but currently solves almost everything I want. Once the server is running this is a very easy tool to use and has some nice features.
